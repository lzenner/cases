The case.tra files need to be put where your other tra's are and has to be included in your array of translation files to be reloaded, and listed where you have the other tra's listed.  Like: 

ALWAYS
	ACTION_DEFINE_ARRAY transitions_noconvert BEGIN setup END
	ACTION_DEFINE_ARRAY transitions_reload BEGIN game cases END       // <<<========

   LAF HANDLE_CHARSETS
      INT_VAR
         infer_charset = 1
      STR_VAR
         tra_path = EVAL ~transitions/languages~
         noconvert_array = transitions_noconvert
         reload_array = transitions_reload
    END
END

LANGUAGE ~American English~ ~american~   
   ~transitions/languages/american/setup.tra~
   ~transitions/languages/american/game.tra~
   ~transitions/languages/american/cases.tra~                // <<<===================

//  etc....

The tpa file can be included anywhere in your tp2 file (or in another tpa) whenever you want to include a proper or uppcase player1 pronoun, like:

/////////////////////////////////////
// CLEAN-UP QUESTS                 //
/////////////////////////////////////
BEGIN @13       // MOD 20
DESIGNATED 20
SUBCOMPONENT @12
INCLUDE ~transitions/components/cases.tpa~    // Add proper and upper case player1 pronouns so I can use it in my dialogue
INCLUDE ~transitions/components/another_one_with_dialogue.tpa~

Then, in your dialogue file:
BEGIN WHATEVER
  IF ~True()~ THEN BEGIN MY_DIALOGUE
    SAY ~<PROPER_HESHE> is too strong for us!  Run for your lives!~
    ...
END

You don't need to worry about incuding the cases.tpa file multiple times in your mod.  They entries will not duplicate.
