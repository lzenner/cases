The case.tra files need to be put where your other tra's are and has to be included in your 
array of translation files to be reloaded, and listed where you have the other tra's listed.  
Treat it just like your GAME.TRA, assuming you use one.
Like: 

ALWAYS
	ACTION_DEFINE_ARRAY transitions_noconvert BEGIN setup END
	ACTION_DEFINE_ARRAY transitions_reload BEGIN game cases END       // <<<========

   LAF HANDLE_CHARSETS
      INT_VAR
         infer_charset = 1
      STR_VAR
         tra_path = EVAL ~transitions/languages~
         noconvert_array = transitions_noconvert
         reload_array = transitions_reload
    END
END

LANGUAGE ~American English~ ~american~   
   ~transitions/languages/american/setup.tra~
   ~transitions/languages/american/game.tra~
   ~transitions/languages/american/cases.tra~                // <<<===================

//  etc....

The tpa file can be included anywhere in your tp2 file (or in another tpa) whenever you want to 
include a proper or upper case player1 pronoun.  Then just call the function.  It only needs to
be run once but can be run multiple times.  The entries will not duplicate.  A good place to put
it is in a section of your ALWAYS block that is set up to only run once - gotta love oxymorons!  
But you can put it anywhere.

Then, in your dialogue file:
